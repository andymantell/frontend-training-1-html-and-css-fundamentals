## Steps

- Set up containers for your columns, and put some "cards" inside them
- Use flexbox to lay the columns out side by side
- Set 100% height on all the containing elements (`html`, `body`, plus your columns etc)
- Style up your columns and cards to look a bit prettier
- Use `overflow-y: auto;` on your columns to make them scrolly
- Use `dragula` (https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula) to enable drag and drop on your cards.
