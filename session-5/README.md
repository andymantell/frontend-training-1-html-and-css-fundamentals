# Session 5

Carrying on with our Trello example from session 4, please add:

- Column headings (Using relative and absolute positioning)
  Refer to http://www.barelyfitz.com/screencast/html-training/css/positioning/
  (Andy will demo this...)
- Add <dialog> elements and open them on click
- Add a close button to the dialog element (Using absolute positioning again)
- Add a heading to the dialog
- Add 2 columns inside the dialog element
  - Put text content in the left column.
  - Add a comment form below it
  - Add some "label" toggles to the right hand column using radio buttons, and style them up to look nice
- Discussion on how we might save the sort order of the cards to a server using "weights"
